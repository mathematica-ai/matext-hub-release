# Matext Hub

**Two products. One system. Shared foundation.**

## Authored Capture
Each material begins in the physical world. Surfaces are photographed and documented. Reality remains present in its origin.

#‍# Generative Fidelity
AI variations obey the physics and structure of matter. Material classes are extended while upholding fidelity. 

#‍# Working Textures
Matext textures are built for use. Each is more than an image: every unit carries maps, metadata, and ownership rights.
